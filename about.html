                        <p> Let me introduce myself. I am not more or less special than anyone else. I can not claim I have had a harder, easier or more unique life than other children born to good parents. But my experiences are my own and they are precious to me. 

                            I am the oldest of five children. My desire to serve, support and please others was fundamental to my development. “Cheylynn, we are so proud of you for being a good example for your siblings. Cheylynn, you are the oldest, you know better than that.” Being responsible, dependable and compassionate became integral qualities of my identity. As a result: I was a successful competitive gymnast, a gymnastics coach from the age of 12 through marriage, a diligent college student and a full time missionary. Living up to the expectations of others was the focus of my early adult years.</p>
                        
                        <p>In 2015 I was in my final semester of college. I had just returned from an internship for Bon Appetit at Google. My trajectory was on track to finish my education with incredible experience, good friends and the prestige of Marriott School of Business on my diploma. However, one day I was in a life threatening car accident. I sustained injuries that put me in the hospital for two weeks and on crutches for several months.I was unable to perform the most basic skills to take care of myself. 
                        
                                After being released from the hospital I went to live with my grandparents. I was devastated. Because of my injuries I was no longer able to walk without a limp. I was unable to coach the gymnasts I was so close to. I was no longer on track to graduate with the cohort of business students with whom I had developed strong connections. I was depressed and disheartened. I was incapable of being the responsible, dependable and compassionate person I had worked to establish throughout my life. All I could do was take care of my physical and emotional needs at the most basic level. </p>
                        
                           <p>In time my injuries healed, I returned to work and I made new friends. I was married in June and in the following 3 years gave birth to three beautiful daughters. I dedicated my life to my children and our home. However, I did not make it a priority to return to school and finish my bachelors. Once again, I was dedicating my life to the pursuit of serving, supporting and pleasing others. </p> 
                        
                            <p>In November of 2022 my life was again interrupted by a life altering series of events. My husband decided he no longer wanted to be a member of my same faith, Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he engaged in a relationship with another woman, and lost his career as a police officer in pursuit of that woman. I was left a single mom with three daughters under the age of five. I had given up my education and my career to serve, support and please my husband. And, as a result I was left with limited tools to provide for my family. </p>
                        
                         <p>Looking back on my life, I recognized a flaw in my decision making processes. While my motivations were genuine and my sacrifices admirable, I was missing the bigger picture. My worth is not determined by the sacrifices I make to please others. I am innately of worth because I am a daughter of God. It is important to fulfill our responsibilities as children of God to become like Him and to love our neighbor. However, part of those responsibilities include loving ourselves, working to improve ourselves and showing respect for our individual divinity. To lose myself in the sole pursuit of pleasing others is to lose the opportunity and gift of personal development that God has given me.</p>
